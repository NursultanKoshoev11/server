I developed a server application using Qt and Boost to handle client connections efficiently and provide real-time data exchange. The server is designed for high performance, ensuring stable communication between clients and the system.

Key Features:

Multithreaded Architecture – utilizes Boost.Asio for efficient handling of multiple client connections.

Client-Server Communication – supports TCP/IP and WebSocket protocols for reliable data transmission.

Database Integration – connects to an MS SQL database for storing and retrieving client data.

Request Processing System – handles various types of client requests, ensuring fast response times.

Security Measures – includes encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect data and user sessions.

Logging and Monitoring – provides real-time logs and performance metrics for system analysis.

Scalability – designed to support an increasing number of clients without performance degradation.

The system is adaptable for various applications, such as online services, multiplayer games, and data management platforms. The combination of Qt and Boost ensures flexibility and efficiency in network operations.
